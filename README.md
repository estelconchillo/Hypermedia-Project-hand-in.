## Project Analysis
> - **Project analysis, User profile: create a user persona for your website.**
>   The final user will be a boss or a person in charge of contracting new workers for the offer that I have applied for.

> - **Project analysis, Information architecture: describe using around 200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the pageâ€™s information.**
>   The name and the photo are the most important things, that is the reason whi I have dicided to put them at the top of the webpage and in a big size. Under the name I put the career that I'm cursing to let the persons know in wich field I am interested to work.
>
> I have decided to divide the webpage in 2 different columns, the first one, it is the one that it is on the left part, and it contains the contact information and then some Key Skills to apport some characteristics about me and finally the languages that I speak wich are important when you are applying for a job.
>
> The second column
> - **Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.**

>
>   The webpage is organized into two main columns to create an organized hierarchy. The left column is a personal and quick references section. At the top, it includes the user's photo and the name, as these are the first elements to capture the attention. Below the photo appears the contact information such as phone number, email and location.

> - **Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.**
>
>   The visual design wants to show professionalism, simplicity and readability. The color palette combines light and dark shades of blue, which are often associated with technology and formalism. The contrast between the light blue sidebar and the white main area helps visually separate personal information from professional content improving clarity.
>
>   I have combined two different typographies, for the titles, I've used "Libre Caslon Text" that gives the page an elegant and formal touch. And for the body text, I have used Inter, wich I like a lot since it's easy to read on screens and has a modern appearance.
>
>   I have included a particular design for the links (mail and location), to make them consistent with the other elements, but when you hover over them they change color.
>
>   The layouts prioritzies alignment and spacing, ensuring that each section is visually balanced. Since it is a static webpage, no interactive elements have been added yet.
>
> I have also added media queries in the CSS to make the website responsive, adapting the layout for different screen sizes such as phones and tablets. Since it is a static webpage, no interactive elements have been added yet.

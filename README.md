## Project Analysis
> - **Project analysis, User profile: create a user persona for your website.**
>   The final user will be a boss or a person in charge of contracting new workers for the offer that I have applied for.

> - **Project analysis, Information architecture: describe using around 200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the pageâ€™s information.**
>
>   The name and the photo are the most important things, that is the reason whi I have dicided to put them at the top of the webpage and in a big size. Under the name I put the career that I'm cursing to let the persons know in wich field I am interested to work.
>
>   I have decided to divide the webpage in 2 different columns, the first one, it is the one that it is on the left part, and it contains the contact information and then some Key Skills to apport some characteristics about me and finally the languages that I speak wich are important when you are applying for a job.
>
>   The second column includes, wich career I'm studying, and then, a profile summary to explain a little bit who I am and under the profile summary there's the education section, wich contains the bachelor that I am studying for and the last thing is the Professional Expierence, an important thing to put if you are applying for a job.
> - **Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.**
>
>   The color palette that I have decided to used is a combination of light and darks blues, I have decided to work with blues because it is related to formal and tech things so I think it would be a correct color to use on a cv.
>
>   I have combined two different typographies, for the titles, I've used "Libre Caslon Text" and for the paragraphs I have used Inter, wich a like a lot since it's easy to read and modern.
>
>   I also have decided to put the first column in light blue to difference the two different columns. And I have included some links like the mail and the ubication.
>   Since it is a static webpage, for the moment, I have not included any interactional elemment.
